# üèì Foosball TrueSkill Tracker

A modern web application for tracking foosball games and managing player ratings using the TrueSkill rating system.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Get up and running in under 5 minutes!**

### Prerequisites
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) - Python package manager
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime (v18+)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - For PostgreSQL database
- Python 3.11+

### Quick Setup (Full Stack)

Choose your preferred development method:

#### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended for simplicity)

```bash
# Start full stack with Docker (database + backend + frontend)
docker-compose up --build

# That's it! Everything runs in Docker:
# - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# - Backend: http://localhost:8000/docs
# - Database: localhost:5432
```

#### Option 2: Local Development (Recommended for active development)

```bash
# 1. Start database only
docker-compose up db -d && sleep 30

# 2. Install and setup backend
uv sync --dev --project backend
uv pip install -e backend
uv run --directory backend alembic upgrade head

# 3. Install and setup frontend
npm install --prefix frontend

# 4. Start backend API server
uv run --project backend uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# 5. In another terminal, start frontend dev server
npm run dev --prefix frontend
```

**üéâ That's it!**
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000/docs (interactive docs)
- Frontend App: http://localhost:3000 (React app)

### Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Test backend endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/health     # Basic health check
curl http://localhost:8000/ready      # Database connectivity check
curl http://localhost:8000/           # API information

# Frontend should show API status on the home page
open http://localhost:3000            # React app with API connectivity test
```

### üß™ Run Test Suite

```bash
# Backend tests (119+ tests total)
uv run --directory backend pytest tests/ -v

# Frontend tests (393+ tests total)
npm run test:run --prefix frontend

# End-to-End tests (3 tests - requires services running)
cd e2e-tests && npx playwright test
```
